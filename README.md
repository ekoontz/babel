# babel

A Clojure library for generation and parsing of natural language expressions.

```shell
demo.sh
```

will demonstrate some of the library's abilities to generate English
expressions. [Here is the output of a sample run of
demo.sh](https://gist.github.com/ekoontz/57c332d85ccf47503666c72fe241cb14)

```shell
lein test
```

will show a more in-depth verification of the library's behavior.
