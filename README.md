# babel

A Clojure library for generation and parsing of natural language expressions.

# Getting Started

```lein test```

I hope the tests will be useful for demonstrating the library's abilities.

# HPSG (Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar)

Babel is based on a linguistic theory called HPSG. For more details please see:
