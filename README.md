# babel

A Clojure library for generation and parsing of natural language expressions.

# HPSG (Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar)

## Linguistic expressions are DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)

## Complex lexical representation

## Phrase structure rules

# Lexicon

## Default rules

# Grammar

# Generation

Generation is a function that takes a specification, a lexicon, and a
grammar and returns an expression.

# Parsing

Parsing is a function that takes an expression, a lexicon, and a
grammar and returns a grammatical representation of the expression.

# Translation

A translation of a source expression into a target expression is a
two-step process: first we determine the semantics of the source
expression, and second, we generate a target expression that has this
identical semantic representation.

## Parsing of the source expression

## Generation of the target expression
